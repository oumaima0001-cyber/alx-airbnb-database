Normalization The database design has been normalized up to the Third Normal Form (3NF) to ensure data integrity and avoid redundancy:

All tables have atomic fields and primary keys (1NF). All non-key attributes depend entirely on the primary key (2NF). No transitive dependencies exist; every attribute directly describes the primary key (3NF).
